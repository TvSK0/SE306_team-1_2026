# AI interaction log

Per the team's shared requirement to log AI interactions and mark affected
code with `// AI-assisted: [description]`. Core UI and business logic is
written by hand; entries below are the exception, each noted as such.

Add an entry per session/PR, newest first.

## 2026-10-15 - Aum, Claude (Opus 5.5)

**Prompt (summarised):** generate unit tests for the Phase 1 model classes
in `lavs.model`.

**What it produced** on `feature/model-classes`:

- Unit tests for `Customer`, `Address`, `PhoneNumber`, `Email`, `Employer`,
  `Loan` and `LoanCoborrower` (`src/test/java/lavs/model`).

**Marking:** each test file carries a `// AI-assisted` comment. Generating
these tests was agreed by the team as an exception to the hand-written rule.

## 2026-10-11 - Gabeliu, Claude Code (Sonnet 5)

**Prompt (summarised):** work through the sprint backlog (build/test/CI
setup, validation framework, eligibility check, a test fake that can go
offline mid-test, US8 and US9 service logic), resolve the main-borrower/
guarantor question if possible, and don't push or open a PR without
checking first.

**What it produced**, each on its own local branch off `main`, none pushed:

- `chore/build-test-ci-setup` - Maven wrapper (mvnw/mvnw.cmd), Mockito,
  JaCoCo (95% branch-coverage gate on the team's own code), excludes the
  starter tests that call the live mainframe server from the default run,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and a build/test/run README section.
- `shared/validation-framework` - `lavs.validation`: `FieldError`,
  `ValidationResult`, `Validators` (required/date/phone/email/currency/
  postcode).
- `shared/eligibility-check` - `lavs.logic.EligibilityChecker` (mailing
  address + phone or email).
- `test/fake-connection-offline` - added the "goes offline mid-test ->
  send() returns a rejection" behaviour to `mainframe.client.FakeConnection`
  (whose scripted-response design originates from Yu Tokuda's unmerged
  `feature/us10-constants` branch - needs reconciling when that merges).
- `feature/us8-loan-coborrowers` - `lavs.logic.LoanBorrowerService`: add/
  remove/update a co-borrower or guarantor via `loan.AddCoborrower`/
  `loan.DeleteCoborrower` (update = remove then re-add). Service logic and
  tests only - the screen is blocked on US6 and a UI framework choice.
- `feature/us9-submit-for-verification` - `lavs.logic.LoanStatusService`:
  submit a loan for verification (-> Pending) via `loan.UpdateStatus`,
  gated on `EligibilityChecker`.
- `docs/ai-interaction-log` - this file.

**Left unresolved, on purpose:** whether a main borrower with no employer
must have a guarantor before a loan can become Pending. The notes suggest
blocking submission on it, but that is flagged as an open question for
James on Ed in this session rather than decided - see the doc comments on
`LoanStatusService`/`EligibilityChecker`.

**Marking:** every file these branches add carries a `// AI-assisted`
comment (or, for the brought-in `FakeConnection.java`, a note on exactly
which lines are new) per the team's rule that core UI/business logic is
written by hand - these backlog cards were the stated exception for this
session.
